Ground is an open-source, map-first data collection and analysis platform built
to seamlessly connect the offline world with cloud-based storage and
computation. The platform consists of a web app for data management and an
Android app for offline data collection. Our goal is to provide a "just right"
data collection solution that meets the needs of community organizers,
conservationists, humanitarian workers, and researchers addressing some of
today's most pressing issues.

**Note:** Ground is not an officially supported Google product, and is developed
on a best-effort basis.

You can learn more about Ground on the [project
website](https://google.github.io/ground-platform).
